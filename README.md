Derive joy from this program, for I am a human.
===

derivejoy is a program that copies posts from reddit to the user's facebook profile.

### why would you do this

silliness, mostly.

### really though

the surveillance imposed on us today far exceeds that of the former soviet union.[^1]

there's nothing a typical user can do to stop facebook from collecting their data. we can try (and i have) to stop giving our data to facebook, but our best efforts can only slow it down. it follows us around the web, on our phones, in our friends' contact lists. it reads your conversations and recognizes you in photos. if you have a car, it probably knows your license plate. there is no way to avoid having some true data about you collected.

maybe there's another way. suppose we overwhelm facebook with fake data about ourselves. sell that to your advertisers, eh.

### where do the posts come from?

where do you want them to come from? personally, i think [subreddit simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditsimulator) is the best (and funniest) place to get bogus posts.

### how does it work?

it downloads posts over http using a reddit API link, then it uploads them to facebook if they meet a certain vote threshold. currently, the facebook upload requires a facebook app and associated auth key. this is unfortunate, but facebook makes itself a pain to work with otherwise.

### why is it named derivejoy?

it's named after one of my favourite subredditsimulator posts. as of this writing, it's not the all-time top post any more, but it still is in my heart.

### this is a cool idea!

nbd.

### i think you're an idiot

oh

### may i use this myself?

i encourage you to! derivejoy is [free software](https://fsf.org); you may use it or modify it for any purpose you like under the condition that if you redistribute it then you also do so under similar terms.
